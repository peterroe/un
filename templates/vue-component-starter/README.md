## Publish your component

> Before you publish your component, you must give your component a new name in order to prevent conflicts with other people's component names.

You better update the registered component name in `src/index.ts`:

```diff
export function install(app: App) {
- app.component('MyComponent', MyComponent)
+ app.component('yourComponentName', MyComponent)
}
```

Run `pnpm build` again to get the right files.

Make sure your are logged into [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and run:

```shell
$ pnpm release 
$ npm publish
```

For more details about publish, please check [bumpp](https://github.com/antfu/bumpp).

## Deploy demo to github page

1. Create a **public** repository in github. And keep the repository's name same as the `package.json`'s name

2. Link the repository to the github repo

```bash
$ git init
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:xxx/xxxx.git
```

3. You can debug your components online in `demo/App.vue`, and they can be deployed directly.

Just run:

```shell
